We educate over 5 400 students from 4-18 years old to embrace challenges and take responsibility for shaping a better world.With these lofty mission and goals in mind when UWCSEA embarked on an extensive building and renovation plan from 2010-2015 it did so with a clear objective to make these projects an opportunity to ""practice what we preach"" and develop the buildings to have a lowest possible environmental footprint within our limited budgets and time constraints.This challenging project touched 17 separate buildings spread over 10 hectares of land with a total GFA of over 87 000 m2 and included not only the buildings but also the underlying infrastructure such as ACMV and power. Through this effort we also worked closely with the students to develop infrastructure to student led green initiatives such as a native tree nursery and a recycling and composting centre on campus.The campus is now home to a number of innovative projects such as the 3 for 2 office air-conditioning project (supported by BCA) an extensive network of water conservation systems that captures and reuses waste water from rain air conditioning condensate and waste water and our most challenging and arguably the most successful project the refurbishment reengineering and relocation of our 15 year old chiller plant to the rooftop of one of our buildings which has brought significant energy savings whilst clearly keeping to the overall principle of reduce reuse and recycle on a grand scale.We are proud to note that despite adding over 25 000m2 of GFA since 2009 our overall electricity bill has actually reduced through a combination of better management user engagement and investment in efficient modern infrastructure.","['Estimated energy savings: 1 814 812 kWh/yr.2.

The restored Old Ford Factory now houses a permanent gallery featuring the exhibition Syonan Years: Singapore Under Japanese Rule 1942 - 1945?.,"['The National Archives of Singapore (NAS) has restored the Old Ford Factory a gazetted national monument because of its historical significance as the venue of the British Surrender to the Japanese on 15 February 1942', 'The building of a new repository block was carried out together with the restoration of the Old Ford Factory to meet the long term storage needs of NAS', 'The restored Old Ford Factory now houses a permanent gallery featuring the exhibition “Syonan Years: Singapore Under Japanese Rule 1942 - 1945”. Memories at Old Ford Factory Going Green', 'In the development of Memories at Old Ford Factory (Memories) sustainability and efficient resource management were two key considerations of NAS besides authenticity and faithfulness in the restoration processes. The four principles of waste management – Reduce Reuse Recycle & Recover - were deeply entrenched in the philosophy of site management and redevelopment throughout the 20 odds months of building and restoring works - both the construction of the new archives repository as well as the set up of the exhibition gallery. Through a number of ‘Green’ innovations NAS hopes to see MOFF turns into a model site where energy and resource consumption is efficient and running cost is maintained at low levels over time. However the implementation of these ‘Green’ features does not only bring cost benefits to the operation of the facilities and compound. Instead these features also serve as illustrations of the relevance of the stories and lessons on innovation and perseverance told in the exhibition to our lives today. These lessons emphasize the importance of sustainability in the use of resources as well as the value of perseverance in finding creative ways to adapt and get around resource scarcity', 'For example part of the exhibition is about the critical role of water in the Malayan Campaign. When key reservoirs in Singapore fell into Japanese hands during the campaign the loss of water supply became one of the key considerations of the British in making the decision to surrender. Likewise today water continues to be a vital resource for Singapore. Without unlimited access to fresh water conservation of water and its sustainable management is more important than ever before for Singapore. In this context the implementation of the rainwater harvesting system thus has greater meaning and connection to the exhibition at Memories. 1. Lighting exhibition displays with cool lights instead of conventional halogen lights traditionally used in museums', 'Within the exhibition gallery Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and Fibre Optic lighting (FOL) systems are adopted as the only sources of display lighting. The objective is to steer the gallery away from the use of conventional halogen systems that are traditionally found in many museums and art galleries. While this move may have resulted a slight higher set up cost in the beginning we were motivated by other long-term benefits that we could harvest from the use of LEDs and FOL as outlined below: ', 'i. The combination of LEDs and FOLs in the gallery at Memories presents an advantage over the halogen system in terms of their lower energy consumption. Based on the required usage of the gallery had we adopted the halogen system we would have consumed 7 883W more power or nearly 80% more than what the gallery now consumed: 2 192W. (Annex 1 shows the breakdown & comparison) ', 'ii. Although the gallery did not display many original records that are extremely sensitive to UV reproduction of exhibits is expensive too and if we could prolong the exhibit lifespan it means reduction of recurrent cost. The use of UV-free LED and FOL thus poses a tremendous advantage over the halogen system as the exhibits will be less susceptible to fading and light damages arising from heat etc. Furthermore with significantly lower heat emission from LED and FOL the amount of stress exerted on the gallery air-conditioning is also reduced.2. Harnessing of solar energy to supplement exhibition display lightingTaking energy conservation efforts in the gallery a step further we have been harnessing solar energy at Memories since September 2006 to supplement the powering of exhibition display lights. Currently 86.4 kWh of power consumed by LED light fixtures within the gallery monthly is totally drawn from solar energy. Correspondingly 1 036.8 kWh of “clean” solar energy is used yearly. This was possible also because LED lights in general consume much lower power than halogen lights. ', 'In line with the principles of waste management various materials from the original building as well as other building projects were recycled and integrated into the exhibition gallery as displays. From the original Ford building damaged mosaic tiles and green tinted glass were re-used in a mosaic map display which is the center piece of the gallery.Fences that once surrounded the Old Parliament House are now used in the gallery as an installation art lending a symbolic meaning from their distinctly colonial design to exhibits at the “Internment of POWs” section as well as in the external landscape of Memories as a safety barrier to prevent visitors from wandering unknowingly to the steep slopes at the corners of our compound.4. Recovering of rainwater to irrigate plants and food crops in the garden and natural landscapes of Memories', 'Beyond the gallery premises the exhibition continues in the “Syonan Garden” which cultivates wartime food crops such as rice sweet potatoes and tapioca. With rainwater harvesting technology rainwater is collected and channeled for watering the garden. Memories is able to collect up to 9 m3 of rainwater weekly with a day of continuous rainfall or equivalent in a week.With sufficient rainfall the system is able to provide recycled rainwater to irrigate the garden and surrounding landscapes of Memories for two hours each day. This saves approximately 468 m3 of potable water used yearly. Come September 2007 the capacity of the system will be expanded further to a total of 1 508 m3 of potable water. The larger capacity will allow the landscapes of Memories to be fully watered by harvested rainwater and generating further savings. 5. Roof garden at the archives repository block.  ', 'The installation of a high density low maintenance garden on the roof of the repository building is an innovative means of insulating our repositories from the Sun’s direct heat. Planted with hardy plants that requires little care the roof garden is easily maintained. More importantly the garden also reduces the temperature and area of the heat source that accumulates on the concrete roof. This brings down the amount of external heat that penetrates into the repositories directly below the roof', 'With the roof garden and layers of insulation applied to the roof a consistent 1-2 degrees drop in temperature in the repository immediately below the roof was achieved. 6. Eco-friendly functions and sustainable practices. In order to achieve sustainable resource management in the long term eco-friendly functions and practices are observed in our daily operations. For example the use of natural lighting is integrated as a display and presentation technique in several parts of the gallery. Other eco-friendly practices that have been integrated into the operations also include fertilizing and maintaining plants and landscapes with organic fertilizers rather than chemical fertilizers as well as the use of motion-sensor taps rather than push taps that can generate significant wastage of water. Dried leaves and weeds that are removed from the garden and landscapes are also recycled and made into organic fertilizers with a compose-maker. Plants and landscapes are also cleverly used in various parts of the centre for functional purposes. Bamboos for example are used in place of conventional steel screens to form a natural and aesthetically pleasing screen to shield the AHU from sight and dampen noise from the units. Similarly plants are also planted along the slopes and driveway to act as natural safety barriers in place of steel fences']",Institutional,"['recreational/culture', 'industrial']","['sustainable management', 'sustainable management', 'sustainable management', 'sustainable management', 'sustainable management', 'resource stewardship', 'sustainable management', 'resource stewardship', 'smart & healthy building', 'sustainable management', 'smart & healthy building', 'building energy performance', 'smart & healthy building', 'sustainable management', 'sustainable management', 'sustainable management', 'sustainable management', 'sustainable management', 'resource stewardship', 'resource stewardship', 'smart & healthy building', 'sustainable management', 'sustainable management', 'sustainable management', 'resource stewardship', 'smart & healthy building', 'sustainable management', 'sustainable management', 'sustainable management', 'sustainable management', 'sustainable management', 'sustainable management', 'building energy performance', 'smart & healthy building']","['sustainable management', 'building energy performance', 'smart & healthy building', 'resource stewardship']"

With this in mind for their new hospital extension development at Victoria Street Raffles Hospital Properties is committed in developing a Green Mark Platinum rated building to be in line with the nationwide green movement.The new proposed medical tower consists of a 20-storey medical building with 2 basements and addition and alteration to the existing Raffles Hospital at Victoria Street. The project will have a total of 20 612 m2 of medical clinic spaces where 5% of the total GFA shall be commercial space.An integrated approach by various consultants is adopted at the planning stage to coordinate various aspects of the building design to ensure that the required Green Mark Platinum energy savings target set out are met when the building is completed and operational.The orientation of the hospital tower is design without any direct west facing faÃ§ade which ensure that the habitable spaces receive minimal solar heat gain. Low-e glass with low shading coefficient in double glazed faÃ§ade systems are used as glass will be the predominant material for the facade system. In addition sun-shading elements in the form of vertical and horizontal fins that cantilever 500mm from the curtain wall are added extensively to provide shading to the faÃ§ade at all orientation to help reduce the amount of heat gain into the building. The window to wall ratio (WWR) of the building curtain wall system is further reduce through the use of spandrel panels in place of glazing units for certain sections to improve the overall thermal resistance of the building.The building faÃ§ade is also designed with a combination of fixed and operable curtain wall systems to allow for maintenance of the green wall and provide the option for natural ventilation to improve the indoor air quality and minimise sick building syndrome. The window openings are positioned to facilitate air flow within the clinics achieving good level of thermal comfort. The mechanical and electrical design for the hospital paid special care to reducing the energy consumption. Energy efficient water-cooled chilled water plant with a system efficiency of 0.65 kW/RT was use as the main air-conditioning system. Heat recovery system will also be incorporated to recover heat from the exhaust system. In addition energy efficient light fittings such as LED T5 fluorescent and compact fluorescent lights were utilised extensively throughout the building. As part of the environmental protection efforts â€˜greenâ€™ materials can be found all over the building. Some examples include waterproofing plasterboard toilet cubicle and carpet certified under the Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS). In addition green concrete with recycled content is used as the construction material of the building. The compost used for the landscaping is also made from recycled horticultural waste. In addition to reduce the carbon footprint public transport will be easily accessible with the public bus stop within walking distance allowing public transport to be a convenient form of alternative transportation.To encourage water efficiency within the warehouse washing basin urinals and flushing cisterns with â€˜Excellentâ€™ rating under the Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme (WELS) will be installed. NEWater will be used for cooling tower and irrigation to reduce usage of potable waterThe development is also designed with extensive greenery in the form of green walls and green roofs cleans air pollutants and offer visual relief for visitors and patients alike besides reducing heat gain to the building. This is featured in a few prominent areas:a) Sky terraces - The raised planters with trees at the sky terraces help shade and reduce heat gain. Besides being a green space for occupants to enjoy the area with abundant communal greenery further improves the permeability of air through the building and helps cool the building during the day. The sky terraces also incorporate the design of aluminum screens which act as living awnings and are good shading devices.b) Vertical greenery - These vegetative green walls can be used to shade the building and create a cool microclimate around the building. And at the same time it adds a touch of greenery to the facades. c) Roof top garden - An intensive green roof improves the thermal resistance of the roof reducing solar heat gain to the clinic spaces below. Furthermore it also improves stormwater retention and reduces the risk of flooding by slowing down stormwater flow into storm drains.d) Water bodies - A podium green roof with reflective pool reduces the urban heat island effect as it minimizes heat being reflected to the surroundings and tower above. The water bodies enhance evaporative cooling and provide additional daytime cooling effect on the microclimate of the surrounding area. The reflective pool at the podium level doubles up as a stormwater detention tank which can be used for non-potable uses such as irrigation and general washing thereby reducing potable water consumption.,['An overall energy saving of 31% is demonstrated with an energy model with an expected EEI of 223 kWh/m2/year2.

Except for the tiny mangrove patch which is the original island the rest of the land was reclaimed many years ago. The design concept is to conserve its natural environment and to design it for Singaporeans to explore experience and enjoy nature at its best. Thus minimum disturbance was the key to achieve this goal. The main task was to preserve the rich biodiversity and its natural resources and to enhance them. Valuable wild flowering shrubs were encouraged to multiple through propagation by cuttings and seed collection. It is a showcase to the garden enthusiasts and professionals alike to use these species for their home garden and their landscape projects. Cutting of some overgrown casuarina trees were necessary to reduce its prolific growth. Selected trees were cut and lumber were recycled into planks for the 200m boardwalk park signs edging to curtail erosion logs were used to create an interactive â€˜Casuarina Exploratoryâ€™ for children and adults alike to explore. The two estuaries separating the â€˜old islandâ€™ provide opportunities for the children to explore and experience aquatic creatures at close range. Numerous bays or beaches were also created for the picnickers.,['Currently there is no potable water line and electricity line into the island; Rainwater is harvested and solar energy is harnessed for toilet usage.2. Extensive use of recycled materials on site â€“e.g. all signages seats benches bike racks and boardwalk were made from casuarinatimber from the trees that had to be felled for the construction of new paths and structures.3. The design takes into consideration many maintenance issues such as vehicle access for maintenance of the vegetation in the entire park.4. During the construction stage many left over construction materials were reused (e.g. sand fill timber boulders stones etc.)5. During construction there was minimal intervention to prevent disturbance to the existing flora and fauna. No heavy machinery was allowed for the construction of the boardwalk so most works were carried out manually (e.g. cutting the planks to fit etc.)6. There are ongoing monitoring programs and newly proposed enrichment programs to enhance the two main habitats â€“mangrove & coastal forests.7. Access paths made from previous concrete were created near each entrance to the island to allow wheelchair users to take a walk in the park'],Others,['recreational/culture'],"['sustainable management', 'sustainable management', 'building energy performance', 'resource stewardship', 'smart & healthy building']","['sustainable management', 'building energy performance', 'smart & healthy building', 'resource stewardship']"
